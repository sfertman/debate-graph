**Supporting/Opposing: {{reference argument}}**

**Avoid duplicates (zombie arguments)**

Zombies shall be dispatched swiftly and mercilessly! The argument graph must remain acyclic at all times. Cycles will be destroyed as soon as they are found without notice!


**Describe your argument in 300 characters or less**

It is true that some arguments just cannot be made this concise but please try! If you find that your entry counts a number of things in support of an argument then create a number of different entries that all reference the entry at hand. If you find that you're making multiple arguments on one thread of thought then create multiple entries referencing each other.


**Use references**

Some arguments can be picked apart just because of inconsistent logic. Factual arguments require to be backed up by existing resources. Try to add references even if it seems like common sense because some people will just keep arguing with the obvious.


**Keep it on topic**

It's easy to get personal when debating anything. Attack the argument; not the debater. Entries which include any reference to the debater making the argument (good or bad) will be either revised by OP or closed entirely.
